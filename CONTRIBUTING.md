Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SmartThings SDK. Our community of developers is what put SmartThings on the map, so whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we will value your feedback and contributions. 

Please take some time to read through our contribution guidelines before submitting any issues or pull requests so we can be sure that we have adequate information to effectively respond to you. 

## Reporting issues or feature requests

Please feel free to use the issue tracker to report issues or suggest features. 

When filing an issue, please check for existing open/recently closed issues to make sure we avoid duplicated efforts. Include as much information as you can. For example:

* The exact SDK version where issue is present
* Relevant modifications
* Atypical or unusual environment variables

## Contributing to models and API methods

Since much of the code is auto-generated from Swagger specification files, any pull requests regarding the generated files will not be accepted and will be immediately closed. 

## Finding contributions to work on

Look at the existing issues for areas of contribution. Searching for issues labeled "help wanted" would be a great place to start. 

## License
